# Healthcare Stroke Risk Analysis

## 📌 Overview

This project analyzes healthcare data to assess **stroke risk** using data science and machine learning techniques. It walks through data exploration, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualizations to help understand the key factors that contribute to stroke risk and to build predictive models that can classify high-risk individuals.

## 🧠 Motivation

Stroke is a leading cause of disability and death worldwide. Early identification of individuals at risk can help in preventive care and timely intervention. This repository demonstrates a reproducible workflow for analyzing clinical and demographic data to:

- Identify patterns associated with stroke
- Build predictive models
- Compare model performance
- Understand important features influencing risk assessment

📊 Project Workflow

1. Data Loading & Inspection
	•	Import data into a DataFrame
	•	Preview structure and sample records

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
	•	Study feature distributions
	•	Visualize correlations
	•	Identify class imbalance

3. Preprocessing
	•	Handle missing values
	•	Encode categorical variables
	•	Scale/normalize where needed

4. Model Development
	•	Train classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM)
	•	Perform model selection and validation

5. Evaluation
	•	Compare models using accuracy, recall, precision, ROC curves
	•	Visualize results for interpretation
